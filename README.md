# Hotel-Bookings-Cancellation-Analysis



## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking cancellations to identify patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can help hotels reduce cancellation rates and optimize revenue generation. The analysis is conducted for two types of hotels: **City Hotels** and **Resort Hotels**.  

### Business Problem  
In recent years, both **City Hotels** and **Resort Hotels** have faced high cancellation rates, leading to reduced revenue and suboptimal room utilization. To address this issue, this project aims to:  
- Analyze factors influencing booking cancellations.  
- Provide actionable business insights for reducing cancellations.  
- Assist hotels in making informed pricing and promotional decisions.

3. Suggested solutions do not have unforeseen drawbacks.  
4. Hotels are not currently employing any recommended solutions.  
5. Clients typically book and cancel reservations within the same year.
